# Question: How do you implement a function to find the Nth node from the end in a singly linked list? C# Summary

The provided C# code defines a singly linked list and implements a function to find the Nth node from the end of the list. The linked list is represented by a Node class, which contains an integer data and a reference to the next node, and a LinkedList class, which maintains a reference to the head node and provides methods to add nodes and find the Nth node from the end. The 'Add' method creates a new node with the given data and appends it to the end of the list. The 'FindNthFromEnd' method uses two pointers to traverse the list. The first pointer, 'refPtr', advances N nodes from the head, while the second pointer, 'mainPtr', starts at the head. Both pointers then advance together until 'refPtr' reaches the end of the list. At this point, 'mainPtr' is at the Nth node from the end. If 'refPtr' reaches the end before advancing N nodes, the method returns -1, indicating that the list has fewer than N nodes. The main program creates a linked list with 5 nodes and prints the value of the 3rd node from the end.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution follows the same logic as the C# version. It also uses two pointers to traverse the linked list and find the nth node from the end. The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in syntax and language features between Python and C#.

1. Class and Method Definitions: In Python, classes and methods are defined using the `class` and `def` keywords respectively. In C#, classes and methods are defined using the `public class` and `public void` keywords respectively.

2. Constructor: In Python, the constructor method is named `__init__`. In C#, the constructor method is named after the class.

3. Self Parameter: In Python, the first parameter of a method is always `self`, which refers to the instance of the class. In C#, there is no such requirement.

4. Null/None: In Python, the keyword `None` is used to represent the absence of a value or a null value. In C#, the keyword `null` is used.

5. Print Statements: In Python, the `print` function is used to print to the console. In C#, the `Console.WriteLine` method is used.

6. String Formatting: In Python, the `format` method is used to format strings. In C#, string formatting is done using the `+` operator.

7. Main Function: In Python, the main function is defined using `if __name__ == "__main__":`. In C#, the main function is defined using `static void Main(string[] args)`.

8. Instantiation: In Python, parentheses are used to instantiate a class (e.g., `Node(data)`). In C#, the `new` keyword is used (e.g., `new Node()`).

9. Error Handling: In the Python version, if `n` is greater than the length of the linked list, the function returns `None`. In the C# version, it returns `-1`.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the solution is interactive and takes input from the user to create the linked list and to find the Nth node from the end. It uses a Scanner object to read the user's input. The linked list is created by pushing new nodes to the head of the list, which is different from the C# version where new nodes are added to the end of the list.

The `getNthFromLast` method in the Java version is equivalent to the `FindNthFromEnd` method in the C# version. Both methods use two pointers to traverse the list. The first pointer moves n nodes into the list, then the second pointer starts at the head of the list and moves along with the first pointer until the first pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the second pointer will be at the nth node from the end of the list.

In terms of language features, both C# and Java have similar syntax and constructs for this problem. Both use classes to define the Node and LinkedList, and both use methods to add nodes and find the Nth node from the end. The main difference is in the way the linked list is created (pushing to the head in Java vs adding to the end in C#) and in the way user input is handled (with a Scanner in Java vs hardcoded values in C#).
